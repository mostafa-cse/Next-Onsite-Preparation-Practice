## Problem - C(Find the Good Sequence) : 

 - two numbers are called "good" if their difference is at least 2
 - a sequence is good if the sequence is increasing
 - a sequence is good adjacent two elements are good
 - a sequence length at least 2
  
 Simple observation and Binary Search on answer(len) Probelem. Now determine on new observation, then optimization. When we get a sequence, this   length will decrease untill it reachs into less then 2. Then agin determine this good sequence/
 Just determine the monotonic function.

## Problem - D(Iftar Party) : 

 Simple Number theory application. Using prime factorization of a number.
 - determine remain Piaju's.
 - Prime factorzie of remain Piaju's.
 - Think when answer will be `Impossible`.


## Problem - E(A Childhood Game) : 

Fully simulation and observation base Problem. 
`যদি প্রথমে শুরু করে Bob:`
`    যদি n % 3 == 0 → Alice জিতবে`
`    না হলে → Bob জিতবে`
`যদি প্রথমে শুরু করে Alice:`
`    যদি n % 3 == 1 → Bob জিতবে`
`    না হলে → Alice জিতবে`
